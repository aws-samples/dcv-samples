## NICE DCV Samples

Welcome to the DCV Samples repository within [AWS Samples](https://github.com/aws-samples). This repository will be used to host samples for NICE DCV integrated workloads. These workloads include managed services that leverage DCV, such as [Amazon WorkSpaces](https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/all-inclusive/) that stream with [WSP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/amazon-workspaces-protocols.html). 

### Glossary 
- DCV/WSP Usage Reports 

### Overview
#### DCV/WSP Usage Reports 
The provided scripts to generate DCV usage reports on Windows illustrate how to use DCV calls to find when a user starts and ends their session. This allows administrators to generate granular usage reports that can be further modified to include additional information. For a walkthrough of how to implement these reports on a WSP Amazon WorkSpace, see this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/desktop-and-application-streaming/generate-custom-usage-reports-for-amazon-workspaces/).
